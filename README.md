Hi I'm Karthika!
I am fascinated by Abstract Neural Networks, Stochastic Learning Models, Knowledge graphs and Mathematical Equations, particularly in Functional Mapping. My research are centered around these domains.

Over the past couple of months, Iâ€™ve had the incredible opportunity to be part of the NASA Open Science program, where I worked on analyzing massive datasets. Alongside this, I collaborated on research challenges with experts in data-driven modeling, further deepening my understanding of large-scale scientific computing. Working alongside Dr. Maneesh Singh and his team, collabrating to advancements in Knowledge Graph Machine Learning, exploring novel methodologies for structured data representation and reasoning.
